# EX 5C Graph coloring

## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
Problem Description:
In a hilly region, several radio towers are installed to provide communication services. However, due to signal interference, two adjacent towers (i.e., in communication range of each other) must not use the same frequency channel.

You are given N radio towers and their communication ranges represented as an undirected graph. Your task is to assign channels (colors) to these towers using at most M channels such that no two adjacent towers use the same channel.

Write a program to determine if such an assignment is possible or not.

Input Format:
First line contains two integers: N (number of towers), and M (number of available frequency channels).

Next line contains an integer E — number of edges representing the communication range.

Next E lines contain two integers u and v — representing that tower u and tower v are within range (0-based index).

Output Format:
Print "YES" if it's possible to assign frequencies to towers such that no two adjacent towers have the same frequency.

Otherwise, print "NO".

## Algorithm
1.Start and read the number of nodes n, available colors m, and edges e.

2.Construct an adjacency list to represent the graph connections.

3.Assign colors to each node one by one using recursion.

4.Before coloring a node, check if assigning the current color is safe (no adjacent node has the same color).

5.If all nodes can be safely colored, print “YES”; otherwise, print “NO.”  

## Program:
```
import java.util.*;

public class prog {

    public static boolean isColorable(List<List<Integer>> graph, int[] color, int node, int m, int n) {
        if (node == n) return true;

        for (int c = 1; c <= m; c++) {
            if (isSafe(graph, color, node, c)) {
                color[node] = c;
                if (isColorable(graph, color, node + 1, m, n))
                    return true;
                color[node] = 0;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    public static boolean isSafe(List<List<Integer>> graph, int[] color, int node, int c) {
        for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
            if (color[neighbor] == c)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt(); // number of towers
        int m = sc.nextInt(); // number of channels
        int e = sc.nextInt(); // number of connections

        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());

        for (int i = 0; i < e; i++) {
            int u = sc.nextInt();
            int v = sc.nextInt();
            graph.get(u).add(v);
            graph.get(v).add(u);
        }

        int[] color = new int[n];

        if (isColorable(graph, color, 0, m, n))
            System.out.println("YES");
        else
            System.out.println("NO");

        sc.close();
    }
}

```
