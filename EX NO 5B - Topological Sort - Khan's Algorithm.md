# EX 5B Topological Sort - Khan's Algorithm

## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
Problem Description:
A software development team is preparing for a product release. The release consists of multiple tasks, each dependent on other tasks being completed first. You are to determine a valid order in which all tasks can be completed. If it's not possible due to cyclic dependencies, output that the release cannot be scheduled.

Each task is labeled from 0 to n-1. The dependencies are provided in the form of pairs [a, b] which means task a depends on task b.

Implement a program to find a valid task execution order using topological sort.

Input Format:

An integer n — number of tasks.

An integer m — number of dependencies.

m lines follow with two integers a and b — representing a depends on b.

Output Format:

If a valid order exists, print the task numbers in a possible execution order (space-separated).

If not, print "Release cannot be scheduled".

## Algorithm
1.Start and read the number of tasks n and dependency pairs.

2.Build a directed graph using an adjacency list and compute the indegree of each node.

3.Add all nodes with indegree = 0 (no dependencies) to a queue.

4.While the queue is not empty:

Remove a task, add it to the task order.

Decrease the indegree of its dependent tasks; if any reaches 0, add it to the queue.

5.Check completion:

If all tasks are processed, print the task order; otherwise, print “Release cannot be scheduled.”


## Program:
```
import java.util.*;

public class prog{

    public static List<Integer> findTaskOrder(int n, int[][] dependencies) {
        List<Integer> order = new ArrayList<>();
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        int[] indegree = new int[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) graph.add(new ArrayList<>());

        for (int[] dep : dependencies) {
            graph.get(dep[1]).add(dep[0]);
            indegree[dep[0]]++;
        }

        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) q.offer(i);
        }

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int curr = q.poll();
            order.add(curr);
            for (int neighbor : graph.get(curr)) {
                indegree[neighbor]--;
                if (indegree[neighbor] == 0) q.offer(neighbor);
            }
        }

        if (order.size() != n) return null;
        return order;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt(); // number of tasks
        int m = sc.nextInt(); // number of dependencies

        int[][] dependencies = new int[m][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            dependencies[i][0] = sc.nextInt(); // a
            dependencies[i][1] = sc.nextInt(); // b
        }

        List<Integer> result = findTaskOrder(n, dependencies);

        if (result == null) {
            System.out.println("Release cannot be scheduled");
        } else {
            for (int task : result) {
                System.out.print(task + " ");
            }
        }
    }
}

```
