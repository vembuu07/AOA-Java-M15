# EX 5D Flower Planting.

## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
You are given n gardens, labelled from 1 to n.

You also have a list called paths, where each element paths[i] = [xi, yi] represents a bidirectional road connectingthe  garden xi and garden yi.

You want to plant one flower in each garden, and there are exactly 4 types of flowers labelled as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Your goal is to plant flowers such that:

No two connected gardens (i.e., connected via a path) have the same flower type.

Return any valid flower assignment as an array where:

answer[i] is the flower type planted in the (i+1) ᵗʰ garden

It is guaranteed that:

No garden is connected to more than 3 other gardens

A valid flower assignment always exists

## Algorithm
1.Start and read the number of gardens n and paths m.

2.Build an adjacency list to represent which gardens are connected.

3.For each garden, check the flower types already used by its connected neighbors.

4.Assign the smallest available flower type (1–4) that isn’t used by any neighbor.

5.After assigning flowers to all gardens, print the final flower arrangement.   

## Program:
```
import java.util.*;

public class GardenFlowerPlanner {

    public static int[] assignFlowers(int n, int[][] paths) {
        @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
        List<Integer>[] adj = new ArrayList[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            adj[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }

        for (int[] path : paths) {
            int a = path[0] - 1;
            int b = path[1] - 1;
            adj[a].add(b);
            adj[b].add(a);
        }

        int[] result = new int[n]; // answer[i] is the flower type of garden i+1

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            boolean[] used = new boolean[5]; // flowers 1 to 4

            for (int neighbor : adj[i]) {
                int flower = result[neighbor];
                if (flower != 0) {
                    used[flower] = true;
                }
            }

            for (int flower = 1; flower <= 4; flower++) {
                if (!used[flower]) {
                    result[i] = flower;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int n = sc.nextInt(); // number of gardens
        int m = sc.nextInt(); // number of paths

        int[][] paths = new int[m][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            paths[i][0] = sc.nextInt();
            paths[i][1] = sc.nextInt();
        }

        int[] result = assignFlowers(n, paths);

        for (int flower : result) {
            System.out.print(flower + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}

```
